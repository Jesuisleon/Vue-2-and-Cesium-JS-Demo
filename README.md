# Vue 2 and Cesium JS Demo

This repository contains sample code for a demo of Vue 2 and Cesium JS. The demo code demonstrates how to integrate these two powerful JavaScript libraries to create interactive, 3D geospatial applications. The code includes a Vue component that embeds a Cesium JS 3D globe, and showcases how to use Vue data binding to update the globe's properties based on user input. The repository also includes documentation on how to set up the development environment and how to run the demo code. Use this repository as a starting point to build your own 3D geospatial applications with Vue 2 and Cesium JS.
